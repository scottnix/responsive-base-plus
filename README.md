Responsive Base Plus
===============

Responsive Base Plus is a solid starting point for creating custom responsive WordPress child themes for the Thematic Theme Framework. The theme was built for my current workflow and rapid development, however you may find it useful. This new version is made for Thematic 2.0+ which is currently in beta.

If you aren't using gulp, it is recommended to delete `package.json` and `gulpfile.js`.

If you aren't using Sass, it is recommended to delete the `/scss/` folder.

Thematic 2.0

You can find more information on Thematic 2.0 in the development branch on [Github](https://github.com/ThematicTheme/Thematic/tree/develop).

Or just download it https://github.com/ThematicTheme/Thematic/archive/develop.zip

Todo
-------------

* Write up more documentation or quick tutorials as questions arise.
* Comment CSS could be slightly better by making the CSS less specific, it totally works fine but the nit-picky person in me knows it could be a little better.
