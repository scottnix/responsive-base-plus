Responsive Base Plus
===============

Responsive Base Plus is a solid starting point for creating custom responsive WordPress child themes for the Thematic Theme Framework. The theme was built for my current workflow, however you may find it useful. This new version is made for Thematic 2.0+.

If you aren't using gulp, it is recommended to delete `package.json` and `gulpfile.js`.

If you aren't using Sass, it is recommended to delete the `/scss/` folder.

Thematic 2.0
-------------

Thematic 2.0 is out, but is still awaiting a WordPress theme review process, so it does not appear in when searching for the theme in the WordPress admin. You will currently need to download it manually and upload it.

Todo
-------------

* Write up more documentation or quick tutorials as questions arise.
* Comment CSS could be slightly better by making the CSS less specific, it totally works fine but the nit-picky person in me knows it could be a little better.
