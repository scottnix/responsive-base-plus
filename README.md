Responsive Base Plus
===============

This new version made for Thematic 2.0+ which is currently in beta. Responsive Base Plus is a solid starting point for creating custom responsive WordPress child themes for the Thematic Theme Framework. The theme was built for myself to use and is setup best for rapid development, however you may find it useful.

If you aren't using gulp, it is recommended to delete `package.json` and `gulpfile.js`.

If you aren't using Sass, it is recommended to delete the `/scss/` folder.

Todo
-------------

* Write up more documentation or quick tutorials as questions arise.
* Comment CSS could be slightly better by making some the CSS less specific, it totally works fine but the nit-picky person in me knows it could be a little better.
