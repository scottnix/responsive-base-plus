More info coming, this is the new version specifically made for Thematic 2.0 which is currently in beta.

Todo/Notes
-------------

* Comment CSS could be slightly better by making some things less specific, it totally works fine but the nit-picky person in me knows it could be a little better.
* The full-width layout that is selectable from the Theme Customizer kills the Primary and Secondary asides, making them useless. This happens in Thematic, not sure how I feel about that since what if you want them, they can appear styled underneath the content, it totally depends on how things are set up with the theme, this could be good or bad. Just a note, the full width Page Template also is exactly the same, no primary/secondary asides available in markup. This also affects layouts weird, if you have a right sidebar layout, and select the page full width template, it will use the full-width layout. So this kind of can be funky, but it totally is dependent on how the site is built. So just test these weird edge cases. Probably going to have to ask Karin about removal of specific Layouts, it would be a nightmare having to build out a bunch of stuff for edge case scenarios "just in case the client picks a different layout in the customizer".
